This repository includes the majority of exercises for first year of Computer Science studies (AGH, WIEiT), course 'Algorithms and Data Structures'.

Not all of the solutions are optimal (I was learning while solving the exercises), some are solved multiple times (sometimes the same way, sometimes I tried to find a new solution).

Unfortunately there is a bit of chaos, although I tried to organize the files into directories the following way:

- directory 'zadanka' includes instructions to problems solved during exercises
- each directory 'lab01' etc. includes
  - a file lab.py which contains problems and short descriptions of the solutions which were presented by the academics during exercises,
  - solved problems from the current topic
- there are also directories 'exams' which include exam problems by year
- and the most chaotically placed excercises from colloqiums
